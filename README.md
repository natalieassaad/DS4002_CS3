## Spam or Ham Identification Case Study 
This repository includes all materials necessary to replicate this study on spam or ham email detection. The goal of this project is to produce three machine learning models (K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, and decision trees) and evaluate model performance based on precision and accuracy to determine which model is most effective at identifying spam emails. 

## Background Materials 
The hook document containing the motivation behind this case study can be found at__. The rubric includes a description for each component necessary for completion of the case study. This document can be found at___. Finally, this repository also contains various reference materials that will help with completing the code. Please find these materials at [REFERENCE FILES](https://github.com/natalieassaad/DS4002_CS3/tree/main/REFERENCE%20FILES). 

## Data 
The datasets used in this case study can be found in the DATA folder. This includes the original dataset ([emails.csv](https://github.com/natalieassaad/DS4002_CS3/blob/main/DATA/emails.csv)) and an example CSV file of final results ([example_model_results.csv](https://github.com/natalieassaad/DS4002_CS3/blob/main/DATA/example_model_results.csv)). 

## Code 
In the CODE folder, you will find the [PreprocessingScript_EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/natalieassaad/DS4002_CS3/blob/main/CODE/PreprocessingScript_EDA.ipynb) file which must be run in order to clean/preprocess the textual data. The file already contains prewritten data cleaning/EDA code, but you will have to fill in the textual preprocessing code. After completing this script and exporting the preprocessed_data.csv, use [AnalysisScript.ipynb](https://github.com/natalieassaad/DS4002_CS3/blob/main/CODE/AnalysisScript.ipynb) to run and complete the code for the analysis. In this script, you will have to complete the code for the KNN and Decision Tree models.
